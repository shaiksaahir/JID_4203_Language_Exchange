# Troubleshooting: 
If the database does not properly migrate into MySQL, this is most commonly because your MySQL root/local instance still has a password or there is no languageexchangematchmaker schema.

To remove your root/local instance password:
* Right click on the local instance.
* Select "Start Command Line Client."
* Enter your password.
* Enter the command: set password for root@localhost='';

To create the correct schema, simply select "Create a new schema in the selected server" within your root/local instance and name it "languageexchangematchmaker"
